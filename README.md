Flight Price Prediction
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting flight prices based on a variety of flight-related features, such as departure time, duration, and airline. By analyzing historical flight data, the model predicts the expected fare for future flights, helping users make informed decisions about when to book.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and structured the dataset by handling missing values, extracting relevant features (e.g., flight duration, departure time), and converting them into numerical formats.
Feature Engineering: Created new features such as total flight duration in minutes and handled categorical variables (e.g., airline, source, and destination).
Modeling: Applied machine learning algorithms to train a predictive model that forecasts flight prices. Multiple models were tested, and the best-performing model was selected based on accuracy metrics.
Evaluation: Used metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on test data.
